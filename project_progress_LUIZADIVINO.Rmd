# Progress
## October 7

Created Dom-Casmurro-Character-Description repo and added files.

Did some exploration analysis, like importing the data using `pdftools`, tokenizing the corpus using `tidytext` and also transforming the data into `tibble` data. I also added a stoplist with "common words" downloaded from github to get only the count on content words, but I had some issues with coding and coudln't apply the stoplist to the dataset.
