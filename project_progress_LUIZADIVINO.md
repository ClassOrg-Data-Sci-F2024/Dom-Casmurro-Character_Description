# Progress

## October 7

Created Dom-Casmurro-Character-Description repo and added files.

Did some exploration analysis, like importing the data using `pdftools`,
tokenizing the corpus using `tidytext` and also transforming the data
into `tibble` data. I also added a stoplist with “common words”
downloaded from github to get only the count on content words, but I had
some issues with coding and coudln’t apply the stoplist to the dataset.
